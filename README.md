# internship-program
Internship program repository containing all the course materials and assignment submissions

The main course materials can be found on https://training.kartoza.com/course/view.php?id=22

Course moderators will create main branches per subject and/or category. The trainees can clone the entire repo to find all the material they require.

As the interns work through the material, they will then be able to upload their assignments to their individual branches for review.
